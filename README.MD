# Introduction

MJML is a markup language designed to reduce the pain of coding a responsive email. Its semantic syntax makes it easy and straightforward while its rich standard components library fastens your development time and lightens your email codebase. MJMLâ€™s open-source engine takes care of translating the MJML you wrote into responsive HTML.


#  MJML-core

MJML-Core contains the engine of MJML. You need to register component via interal API or a `.mjmlconfig` in order to render them. Take a look at [MJML-core's readme](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml/tree/master/packages/mjml-core/README.MD)

## Installation

Launch `npm install` after cloning the repository, then `gulp install`.

From now you have to do `npm link` in each package, `npm link mjml-core` in each package that depends on `mjml-core`.

## Upcomming Features
